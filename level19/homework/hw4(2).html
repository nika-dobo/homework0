    <p>Automobili Lamborghini S.p.A., usually referred to as Lamborghini or colloquially Lambo, (Italian: [autoˈmɔːbili
        lamborˈɡiːni]) is an Italian manufacturer of luxury sports cars and SUVs based in Sant'Agata Bolognese. The
        company is owned by the Volkswagen Group through its subsidiary Audi.

        Ferruccio Lamborghini (1916–1993), an Italian manufacturing magnate, founded Automobili Ferruccio Lamborghini
        S.p.A. in 1963 to compete with Ferrari. The company was noted for using a rear mid-engine, rear-wheel drive
        layout. Lamborghini grew rapidly during its first decade, but sales plunged in the wake of the 1973 worldwide
        financial downturn and the oil crisis. The firm's ownership changed three times after 1973, including a
        bankruptcy in 1978. American Chrysler Corporation took control of Lamborghini in 1987 and sold it to Malaysian
        investment group Mycom Setdco and Indonesian group V'Power Corporation in 1994. In 1998, Mycom Setdco and
        V'Power sold Lamborghini to the Volkswagen Group where it was placed under the control of the group's Audi
        division.

        New products and model lines were introduced to the brand's portfolio and brought to the market and saw an
        increased productivity for the brand. In the late 2000s, during the Great Recession, Lamborghini's sales dropped
        nearly 50%.

        Lamborghini currently produces the V10-powered Huracán, the Urus SUV powered by a twin-turbo V8 engine, and the
        Revuelto, a V12/electric hybrid, as of 2024. In addition, the company produces V12 engines for offshore
        powerboat racing.

        Lamborghini Trattori, founded in 1948 by Ferruccio Lamborghini, is headquartered in Pieve di Cento, Italy, and
        continues to produce tractors. Since 1973, Lamborghini Trattori has been a separate entity from the
        Lamborghini's automobile division.</p>
